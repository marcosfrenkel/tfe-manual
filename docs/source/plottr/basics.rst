Basic usage
===========

Installation
------------

There are multiple options:

Recent stable versions can be installed either with pip (``$ pip install plottr``)
or conda, using the conda-forge channel (``$ conda install -c conda-forge plottr``).

If you want to play with the most recent versions, or contribute to the development,
it makes sense to install from github directly.
In that case, clone the `github repo <https://github.com/toolsforexperiments/plottr>`_,
and install into the desired environment using the
`editable pip install <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-e>`_.
