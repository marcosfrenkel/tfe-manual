================

This is the main documentation for `QCoDeS <https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/>`__ based instrument.
`plottr` is written in python (version 3.8+) and has been tested to work well on Windows, Linux,
and MacOS.
This documentation is still very much ongoing work in progress, but should (hopefully!)
already give an overview of what it's about, and how to use it.
